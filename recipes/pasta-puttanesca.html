        <h2>Description</h2>
        <p>I first tried this lovely, salty dish at Sirianni's Caf&eacute; in Davis, WV.
            I was a bit afraid to try anchovies and capers for the first time, but it was definitely worth it!
            This particular recipe comes from <a href="https://www.budgetbytes.com/pasta-puttanesca/">Budget Bytes</a> and serves 5.
        </p>

        <h2>Ingredients</h2>
        <ul>
            <li>2 tablespoons olive oil</li>
            <li>1 yellow onion, diced</li>
            <li>4 cloves garlic, minced</li>
            <li>3 anchovy filets</li>
            <li>1 28oz. can crushed tomatoes</li>
            <li>1/2 teaspoon dried basil</li>
            <li>1/4 teaspoon crushed red pepper</li>
            <li>1/2 cup sliced kalamata olives</li>
            <li>2 tablespoons capers</li>
            <li>1 lb spaghetti</li>
        </ul>

        <h2>Steps</h2>
        <ol>
            <li>Add the olive oil, onion, garlic, and anchovy filets to a large skillet and saut&eacute; over medium heat until the onions are soft and 
                the anchovies have dissolved.
            </li>
            <li>Add to the skillet the can of crushed tomatoes, basil, crushed red pepper, sliced olives, and capers.
                Stir to combine, then allow to come up to a simmer. Turn the heat down low and let simmer, stirring occasionally.
            </li>
            <li>Boil a large pot of water over high heat and add the spaghetti. Boil about 7 minutes, then reserve about 1/2 cup of the pasta water before draining.</li>
            <li>Add the cooked spaghetti to the saice in the skillet. Stir to combine, then serve hot.</li>
