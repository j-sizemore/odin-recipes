        <h2>Description</h2>
        <p>This recipe comes from <a href="https://www.simplyrecipes.com/recipes/banana_bread">Simply Recipes</a>.
            I haven't attempted it yet, but it sure looks yummy! It also has lots of good reviews.
        </p>
        <p>My grandma has made banana bread for me for as long as I can remember.
            It's one of my favorite deserts (yes, I call it a desert, even though it's called <i>bread</i>!).
            Hopefully, this recipe will make a loaf half as good as my grandma's.

            <li>1/2 teaspoon baking soda</li>
            <li>1 pinch salt</li>
            <li>3/4 cup sugar</li>
            <li>1 large egg, beaten</li>
            <li>1 teaspoon vanilla extract</li>
            <li>1 1/2 cups all-purpose flour</li>
        </ul>

        <h2>Steps</h2>
        <ol>
            <li>Preheat the oven to 350&deg;F and butter an 8 x 4-inch loaf pan.</li>
            <li>In a mixing bowl, mash the bananas with a fork until smooth. Stir in the melted butter.</li>
            <li>Mix in the remaining ingredients until combined.</li>
            <li>Pour into the prepared loaf pan and bake for 55 to 65 minutes until baked. 
                You may need to add a foil tent if the exterior is completedly baked but the interior is still wet.</li>
            <li>Remove from the oven and let cool for a few minutes. Serve.</li>
        </ol>
