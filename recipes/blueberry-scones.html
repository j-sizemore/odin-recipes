            <h2>Description</h2>
            <p>This recipe from <a href="https://www.foodnetwork.com/recipes/tyler-florence/blueberry-scones-with-lemon-glaze-recipe-1914780">Food Network</a> 
                is one that I come back to every year after blueberry picking in late June. It's a hit with my family, and I'm sure it'll be a hit with you 
                as well!
            </p>

            <h2>Ingredients</h2>
            <h3>Blueberry Scones:</h3>
            <ul>
                <li>2 cups all-purpose flour</li>
                <li>1 tablespoon baking powder</li>
                <li>1/2 teaspoon salt</li>
                <li>2 tablespoons sugar</li>
                <li>5 tablespoons unsalted butter, cold, cut in chunks</li>
                <li>1 cup fresh blueberries</li>
                <li>1 cup heavy cream, plus more for brushing</li>
            </ul>
            <h3>Lemon Glaze:</h3>
            <ul>
                <li>1/2 cup freshly squeezed lemon juice</li>
                <li>2 cups confectioners' sugar, sifted</li>
                <li>1 tablespoon unsalted butter</li>
                <li>1 lemon, zest finely grated</li>
            </ul>

            <h2>Steps</h2>
            <ol>
                <li>Preheat the oven to 400&deg;F.</li>
                <li>Sift together the flour, baking powder, salt, and sugar. Cut in the butter until the mixture resembles coarse crumbs.
                    Fold in the blueberries, being careful not to mash the berries.
                </li>
                <li>Make a well in the center of the batter and pour in the heavy cream. Fold just to incorporate; do not overwork the dough.</li>
                <li>Press the dough into a 12 x 3 inch rectangle. Cut into 4 squares parallel to the short side of the rectangle. Then, cut those
                    squares in half diagonally to form triangles. Transfer to a parchment-lined baking sheet, brush with heavy cream, and bake 
                    for 15 to 20 minutes until golden brown.
                </li>
                <li>While the scones are baking, prepare the lemon glaze. Melt the butter in a double-boiler, then whisk in the lemon juice and zest.
                    Add the confectioners' sugar about 1/4 cup at a time and whisk until dissolved.
                </li>
                <li>Once the scones have finished baking, drizzle the glaze over top. Let rest for a few minutes, then serve warm.</li>
            </ol>
